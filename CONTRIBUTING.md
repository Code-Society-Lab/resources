## Adding resources

If you want to add a resource the list, this is how you do it.

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!

1. Access the list's GitHub page. For example: https://github.com/Code-Society-Lab/resources
2. Click on the [`readme.md`](https://github.com/Code-Society-Lab/resources/blob/main/README.md) file: 
3. Now click on the edit icon.
4. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor.
5. Commit the changes, and then click on "Propose file change".
6. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

### Note
If the resource(s) you want to add doesn't fit any category already in the list, simply add it. You can also add sub categories if
necessary.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of the list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
